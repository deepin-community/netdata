Description: real-time performance monitoring (metapackage)
 Netdata is distributed, real-time, performance and health monitoring for
 systems and applications. It provides insights of everything happening on the
 systems it runs using interactive web dashboards.
 .
 It can run autonomously without any third party components or it can be
 integrated to existing monitoring tool chains (Prometheus, Graphite,
 OpenTSDB, Kafka, Grafana, etc).
 .
 This package is a metapackage depending on the typical netdata components.

Description: real-time performance monitoring (apache integration)
 Netdata is distributed, real-time, performance and health monitoring for
 systems and applications. It provides insights of everything happening on the
 systems it runs using interactive web dashboards.
 .
 Netdata includes its own embedded webserver, by default listening on localhost
 only. To make netdata available to other users, a dedicated webserver such as
 apache should be used (with authentication and encryption).
 .
 This package contains the integration for the apache HTTP server.
